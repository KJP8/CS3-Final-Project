# CS3 Final Project
By Keeley Peck

Github: https://github.com/KJP8/CS3-Final-Project

## What is it?
My project is an application where users can add food items to a grocery list. The added items are stored in local storage so that a user can access the site from the same client/browser and always have access to his own list. Users can also delete foods from the list. In addition, whenever a user adds a food to the list, the user is presented with nutrition facts about that food, which is retrieved from the Nutritionix API.

## What will TF need?
TF will need to use local web server (MAAM or XXAMP, for example) and access the page via localhost in order to run API queries.
Alternatively, if you'd like to see it in action without having to edit your Apache config file, you can access the site directly at http://cs3.keeleypeck.me/

1. DOM element creation, deletion or modification
2. Capturing and handling events
